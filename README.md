This repo contains a python notebook that compares execution times and accuracy
of several sklearn classifiers.

Stellar Classification uses the spectral data of stars to categorize them into
different categories. The modern stellar classification system is known as the
Morgan–Keenan (MK) classification system. It uses the old HR classification
system to categorize stars with their chromaticity and uses Roman numerals to
categorize the star’s size.
